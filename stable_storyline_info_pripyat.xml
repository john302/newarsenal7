		<text>The stash contained a short report on how Fang and I infiltrated the underground galleries under the station sarcophagus and found a suspicious-looking door. Fang said that he'd put together a decoder for the electronic lock for our next visit. After that we had to run for our lives. There were hordes of Monolith patrols there. Well. According to the report, we gave the finished decoder to our man in Zaton, who goes by the name of Owl. Now I need to get the decoder from him. I should ask Tomatovich to show me the way to Zaton. He should be somewhere near the Hotel. Me and Fang drew up some plans to get to the door and use the decoder. However, it seems that approaching the Monolith is extremely dangerous - last time we avoided going under the sarcophagus, above the destroyed reactor. Apparently, that's where the Monolith is.</text>
